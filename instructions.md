## Homework

- Create a new project utilizing all of the skills you have so far.
- This project should take advantage of some sort of database. Be prepared to discuss why you chose the one you did and what benefits it provided.
- This does not have to be as large of a scale as the previous projects but should challenge yourself.
  - If there is sufficient enough functionality you want to implement on your personal project you are welcome to expand on that.
- Ensure that all of your work is completed by Monday. We will be deploying these projects to the internet on Wednesday.
